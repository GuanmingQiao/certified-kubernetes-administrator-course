# Rolling Updates and Rollback
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/rolling-updates-and-rollbacks/)
  
In this section, we will take a look at rolling updates and rollback in a deployment

## Rollout and Versioning in a Deployment

  ![rollv](../../images/rollv.PNG)
- Each new version of deployment gets a new `revision` number.
  
## Rollout commands
- You can see the status of the rollout by the below command
  ```
  $ kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment
  ```
- To see the history and revisions
  ```
  $ kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp-deployment
  ```

## Deployment Strategies
- There are 2 types of deployment strategies
  1. Recreate
  2. RollingUpdate (Default Strategy)

## kubectl apply
- To update a deployment, edit the deployment and make necessary changes and save it. Then run the below command.
  ```
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
   name: myapp-deployment
   labels:
    app: nginx
  spec:
   template:
     metadata:
       name: myap-pod
       labels:
         app: myapp
         type: front-end
     spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:1.7.1
   replicas: 3
   selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: front-end       
  ```
  ```
  $ kubectl apply -f deployment-definition.yaml
  ```
- Alternate way to update a deployment say for example for updating an image.
  ```
  $ kubectl set image deployment/myapp-deployment nginx=nginx:1.9.1
  ```
  
## Recreate vs RollingUpdate
- View difference in update strategy as reflected in the Deployment events: `kubectl describe deployment ${deployment_name}`

## Upgrades
- Under the hood, when a deployment in upgraded, a new ReplicaSet is created, and the old one slowly scaled down
- To view a rollout
  ```
  $ kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment
  $ kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp-deployment
  ```
## Rollback
  
  ![rb](../../images/rb.PNG)
  
- To undo a change
  ```
  $ kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deployment
  ```
  
## kubectl create
- To create a deployment
  ```
  $ kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
  ```
## Summarize kubectl commands
```
$ kubectl create -f deployment-definition.yaml
$ kubectl get deployments
$ kubectl apply -f deployment-definition.yaml
$ kubectl set image deployment/myapp-deployment nginx=nginx:1.9.1
$ kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment
$ kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp-deployment
$ kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deployment
```

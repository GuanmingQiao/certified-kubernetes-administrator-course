# Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/taints-and-tolerations-vs-node-affinity/)

In this section, we will take a look at Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity

- Taint: a *Node's trait* that acts like a pod repellent (rejects Pod)
- Taint Effects:
  - No Execute: New Pods will not be scheduled, and evict existing Pod that do not tolerate taint.
  - No Schedule: will not place pod on a node
  - Prefer No Schedule: will try not to place pod on a node, but no guarantee
- Taint Command: `kubectl taint nodes ${node_name} ${label_key}=${label_value}:${taint_effect}`
- Taint Spec: `taints` list, with each entry `effect`, `key`, `value`

- Tolerance: a *Pod's trait* that acts to breach repellent. If a Pod A is tolerant of Node B's taint, then scheduler _can_ place Pod A on Node B  
- Tolerance Spec: `tolerance` map, with `label_key`, `operator`, `label_value`, `taint_effect`

  - Operators: `Equal` or `Exists`. Exists will only check `label_key` matching, while Equal will also check `label_value` matching.

- Taints and Tolerations do not guarantee that the pods will only prefer these nodes; in this case, the red pods may end up on one of the other nodes that do not have a taint or toleration set.

- As such, a combination of taints and tolerations and node affinity rules can be used together to completely dedicate nodes for specific parts.

- Node Selector: a *Pod trait* that selects which nodes can a Pod run on
  
- Node Selector Spec: `nodeSelector` map, with `label_key`, `label_value`

- Node Label: a *Node trait* that works with node selectors

- Label Command: `kubectl label nodes ${node_name} ${label_key}=${label_value}`
